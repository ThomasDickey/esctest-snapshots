	* tests/cht.py: document test_CHT_IgnoresScrollingRegion

	* tests/bs.py: explain reverse-wrap versus margins

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: fix per Nachman comment:
	- Move the call to unmaximize before the assertion to improve the odds of it happening in:
	  * test_XtermWinops_MaximizeWindow_Horizontally
	  * test_XtermWinops_MaximizeWindow_Vertically

	* escutil.py: change commented-out LogInfo to a LogDebug

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: fix per Nachman comment:
	- In test_XtermWinops_MaximizeWindow_HorizontallyAndVertically,
	move esccmd.XTERM_WINOPS(esccmd.WINOP_MAXIMIZE, esccmd.WINOP_MAXIMIZE_EXIT)
	to before the assertions. If they fail the window will be stuck maximized.

2018-04-16  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* LICENSE, README.txt:
	update to 2018/04/16 version from https://github.com/gnachman/esctest

2018-04-15  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* tests/xterm_winops.py:
	Nachman's objecting to use of char-sizes when he asked for pixels.
	Start refactoring by using an if-statement to restore his original
	version (except for a couple of cases where the naming wasn't consistent,
	including one where the name was incorrect - seen with pylint).

2018-04-14  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* tests/da.py: first cut/workable DA response

2018-04-09  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* tests/decdc.py: perhaps he needs a better test...

	* tests/decfi.py, tests/decbi.py: clarified

	* tests/cht.py: test was wrong - fix

	* tests/bs.py: align with xterm #332

	* tests/dl.py: fixed

	* esc.py: add BEL, so I can send it in a test to pinpoint trace

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: comment-out - some fail, will revisit

	* tests/sd.py: works now :-)

	* tests/ich.py: works for me

2018-04-08  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* tests/xterm_winops.py:
	try to restore screen between maximizing (would need a composite test too)

	* esccmd.py: another code

	* tests/xterm_winops.py:
	try adding timing fixes (doesn't seem to help, but doesn't hurt)

	* tests/xterm_winops.py:
	hmm - no progress, but I see that some "Passes" are due to starting from
	a maximized state.

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: still 3 (problem with iconify/deiconfy?)

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: 3...

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: 4...

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: 5...

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: 6...

	* tests/xterm_winops.py:
	partial repair for fvwm - down to 7 failures (no change for XQuartz)

	* escutil.py: add functions for new xterm controls

	* esccmd.py: add codes for new xterm controls

	* tests/xterm_winops.py:
	partly improved: I found that XQuartz is ignoring the maximize horz/vert
	calls though it honors fullscreen.  When switching to fvwm session, I
	get a bunch of regressions due to confusing pixels and chars.  Check this
	in, to focus on those...

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: another bogus test

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: 2 bogus tests fixed.

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: explain

	* tests/xterm_winops.py: fixed test

	* tests/ris.py: fix

	* tests/decset.py: corrected test

	* tests/save_restore_cursor.py: xterm #328 has fix for wraptest -

	* tests/decset.py: works for me

	* tests/decscl.py: works for me (DECSCL except for the "expected" RIS)

	* tests/deccra.py: works for me - but his expected value was wrong

2018-04-04  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* tests/da.py:
	works for me (I fixed that in January 2015 from report by Nachman)

	* tests/decrqss.py, tests/decera.py, tests/decsera.py, tests/decic.py, tests/decdc.py, tests/xterm_winops.py:
